Exploring Advanced Python Tools for Machine Learning and AI

The "ontario_public_library_statistics_2022_open_data dataset" contains details about public libraries in different townships in Ontario, Canada, including their numbers, survey years, service types, addresses, funding information, collection sizes, programme attendance, and various other metrics related to library operations and services. This dataset is useful for performing analysis on library performance, funding distribution, programme participation, and resource management. The dataset is well suited for machine learning applications, including creating predictive models to forecast library performance based on various factors or clustering libraries based on their features and services provided, thanks to its extensive coverage of library operations, funding sources, and community engagement. It may also be utilised to learn more about patterns in library usage and spot chances to enhance outreach and service initiatives.

Steps Included:

1.Data Exploration: Using Pandas, load the dataset and examine it to learn about its structure, feature names, and target labels.
2.Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing includes looking for missing data, dealing with outliers, encoding categorical variables, and, if necessary, feature scaling.
3.Implement Machine Learning Models: To categories the dataset's species, use scikit-learn to create different machine learning models as  SVM Classifier, Random Forest Classifier.
4.Visualization: Construct visualizations to display the models' decision limits or contrast their results.
